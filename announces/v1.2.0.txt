Myrrha provides the coercion framework which is missing to Ruby. Coercions
are simply defined as a set of rules for converting values from source to target
domains (in an abstract sense). As a typical and useful example, it comes with 
a coerce() method providing a unique entry point for converting a string to 
a numeric, a boolean, a date, a time, an URI, and so on.  

Changes:

# 1.2.0 / 2011-08-15

* Added the ability to created SByC domains through simple module extension:

      NegInt = Myrrha.domain(Integer){|i| i < 0}
      
  can also be built the following way:

      class NegInt < Integer
        extend Myrrha::Domain
        
        def self.predicate
          @predicate ||= lambda{|i| i < 0}
        end
        
      end

* Cleaned the development dependencies, travis-ci.org continuous integration,
  and ruby.noe template.
